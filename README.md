Netflix's Squid Game in Java, but with less horror ðŸ˜†. 

# Explaination
Hey Tea lovers! Before talking about Squid Game in Java, let me ask you What do you do on a bored Sunday afternoon? Go out, have fun, or do Netflix and Chill right. Well, I did Netflix and chill. Well, not chill, but experienced a rollercoaster of emotions with the sensational Korean Drama Squid Game on Netflix. Oh Boy! What a massive hit it is. One of the best series I have seen. It has all the things and the story is gripping. Oh sorry, I am off to a different tangent. I know itâ€™s not a movie review blog, but I canâ€™t help but be amazed.

Anyway, the thing I wanted to talk about is the games played in Squid Game. The games are very fun (Not like in the series but in real life). So I tried to replicate the same in Java. So I started with the Red Light Green Light.
